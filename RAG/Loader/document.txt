The Journey Within

In quiet hours when all is still,
The soul begins its climb uphill.
Beyond the noise, beyond the race,
It seeks a calm, a sacred place.

The stars may shine, the winds may howl,
Yet peace is not in things so foul.
It lies within, so deep, so true,
A spark of light in me and you.

The world outside is loud and fast,
But moments pass—they never last.
What’s real is not the gold or fame,
But kindness shown without a name.

Each sunrise brings a brand-new chance,
To lift your head, to dream, to dance.
To learn, to fall, to rise again,
To walk through joy, to weep through pain.

No map can guide, no compass steer,
The roads that bring your purpose near.
For truth is found not out, but in,
The heart’s own voice, beneath the din.

So pause awhile and close your eyes,
Let silence teach, let stillness rise.
You’ll find the path, though dim it seems,
Is lit by love and shaped by dreams.
